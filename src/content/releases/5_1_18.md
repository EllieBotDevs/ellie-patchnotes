### Added

- Added `.translateflags` / `.trfl` command.
    - Enable on a per-channel basis.
    - Reacting on any message in that channel with a flag emoji will post the translation of that message in the
      language of that country
    - 5 second cooldown per user
    - The message can only be translated once per language (counter resets every 24h)
- `.timely` now has a button. Togglable via `.conf gambling` it's called pass because previously it was a captcha, but captchas are too annoying

## Changed

- [public bot] Patreon reward bonus for flowers reduced. Timely bonuses stay the same
- discriminators removed from the databases. All users who had ???? as discriminator have been renamed to ??username.
    - all new unknown users will have ??Unknown as their name
- Flower currency generation will now have a strikeout to try combat the pickbots. This is the weakest but easiest protection to implement. There may be more options in the future

## Fixed

- nunchi join game message is now ok color instead of error color
