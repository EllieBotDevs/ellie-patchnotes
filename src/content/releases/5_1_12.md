### Added

- Added support for `seq` for logging. If you fill in seq url and apiKey in creds.yml, bot will sends logs to it

### Fixed

- Fixed the Check for updates service not using the right URL and spitting an error in the console.
- Fixed another bug in `.greet` / `.bye` system, which caused it to show wrong message on a wrong server occasionally
