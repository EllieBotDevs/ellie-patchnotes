### Added
 
 - Schedule commands!
   - `.scha <time> <text>` adds the command to be excuted after the specified amount of time
   - `.schd <id>` deletes the command with the specified id
   - `.schl` lists your scheduled commands
 - `.masskick` added as massban and masskill already exist
 - `.xpex` and `.xpexl` are back, as there was no way to exclude specific users or roles with .xprate

### Fix
 
 - `.xprate` will now (as exclusion did) respect parent channel xp rates in threads
   - the xprate system will first check if a thread channel has a rate set
   - if it doesn't it will try to use the parent channel's rate
