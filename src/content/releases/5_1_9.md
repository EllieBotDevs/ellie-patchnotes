### Fixed

- Fixed `.greettest`, and other `.*test` commands if you didn't have them enabled.
- Fixed `.greetdmtest` sending messages twice.
- Fixed a serious bug which caused greet messages to be jumbled up, and wrong ones to be sent for the wrong events.
  - There is no database issue, all greet messages are safe, the cache was caching any setting every 3 seconds with no regard for the type of the event
  - This also caused `.greetdm` messages to not be sent if `.greet` is enabled
  - This bug was introduced in 5.1.8. PLEASE UPDATE if you are on 5.1.8 
- Selfhosters only: Fixed marmalade dependency loading
  -  Note: Make sure to not publish any other DLLs besides the ones you are sure you will need, as there can be version conflicts which didn't happen before.
