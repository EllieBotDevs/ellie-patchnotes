### Changed

- Live channels `.lcha` is limited to 1 for now. It will be reverted back to 5 in a couple of days at most as some things need to be implemented.

### Fixed

- `.antispam` won't break if you have thread channels in the server anymore
- `.ve` now works properly
- selfhosters: `.yml` parsing errors will now tell you which .yml file is causing the issue and why.
