### Added

- `'serverlist` is now paginated

### Changed

- `'listservers` renamed to `'serverlist`

### Fixed

- `'afk` messages can no longer ping, and the response is moved to DMs to avoid abuse
- Possible fix for `'remind` timestamp
 
### Removed
- Removed old bloat / semi broken / dumb commands 
  - `'memelist` / `'memegen` (too inconvenient to use)
  - `'activity` (useless owner-only command)
  - `'rafflecur` (Just use raffle and then award manually instead)
  - `'rollduel` (we had this command?)
- You can no longer bet on `'connect4`
- `'economy` Removed.
  - Was buggy and didn't really show the real state of the economy.
  - It might come back improved in the future 
- `'mal` Removed. Useless information / semi broken
