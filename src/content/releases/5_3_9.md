## Added  

- Added `.todo archive done <name>` 
    - Creates an archive of only currently completed todos 
    - An alternative to ".todo archive add <name>" which moves all todos to an archive

## Changed

- Increased todo and archive limits slightly
- Global ellie captcha patron ad will show 12.5% of the time now, down from 20%, and be smaller 
- `.remind` now has a 1 year max timeout, up from 2 months

## Fixed

- Captcha is now slightly bigger, with larger margin, to mitigate phone edge issues
- Fixed `.stock` command, unless there is some ip blocking going on
