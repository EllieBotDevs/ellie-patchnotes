    - Added `.dmmod` and `.dmcmd` - you can now disable or enable whether commands or modules can be executed in bot's
      DMs

## Changed

- Giveaway improvements
    - Now mentions winners in a separate message
    - Shows the timestamp of when the giveaway ends
- Xp Changes
    - Removed awarded xp (the number in the brackets on the xp card)
    - Awarded xp, (or the new level set) now directly apply to user's real xp
    - Server xp notifications are now set by the server admin/manager in a specified channel
- `.sclr show` will now show hex code of the current color
- Queueing a song will now restart the playback if the queue is on the last track and stopped (there were no more tracks
  to play)

## Fixed

- .setstream and .setactivity will now pause .ropl (rotating statuses)
- Fixed `.sar ex` help description

## Removed

- `.xpnotify` command, superseded by `.notify`, although as of right now you can't post user's level up in the same
  channel user last typed, because you have to specify a channel where the notify messages will be posted
