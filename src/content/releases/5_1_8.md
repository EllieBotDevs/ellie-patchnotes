### Added

- Added `.leaveunkeptservers` which will make the bot leave all servers on all shards whose owners didn't run `.keep` command.
  - This is a dangerous and irreversible command, don't use it. Meant for use on the public bot.
- `.adpl` now supports custom statuses (you no longer need to specify Playing, Watching, etc...)

### Changed

- `.quote` commands cleaned up and improved
  - All quote commands now start with `.q<whatever>` and follow the same naming pattern as Expression commands
  - `.liqu` renamed to `.qli`
  - `.quotesearch` / `.qse` is now paginated for easier searching
- `.whosplaying` is now paginated
- `.img` is now paginated
- `.setgame` renamed to `.setactivity` and now supports custom text activity. You don't have to specify playing, listening etc before the activity
- Clarified and added some embed / placeholder links to command help where needed
- A lot of code cleanup and internal improvements

### Fixed
