## Added

- Added player skill stat when fishing
  - Starts at 0, goes up to 100
  - Every time you fish you have a chance to get an extra skill point
  - Higher skill gives you more chance to catch fish (and therefore less chance to catch trash)

## Changed

- Patrons no longer have `.timely` and `.fish` captcha on the public bot

## Fixed

- Fixed fishing spots again (Your channels will once again change a spot, last time hopefully)
  - There was a mistake in spot calculation for each channel
