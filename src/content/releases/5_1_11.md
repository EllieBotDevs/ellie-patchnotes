### Added

- Added `%user.displayname%` placeholder. It will show users nickname, if there is one, otherwise it will show the username.
  - Nickname won't be shown in bye messages.
- Added initial version of grpc api. Beta
 
### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which caused `.bye` and `.greet` messages to be randomly disabled
- Fixed `.lb -c` breaking sometimes, and fixed pagination

### Changed

- Youtube now always uses `yt-dlp`. Dropped support for `youtube-dl`
  - If you've previously renamed your yt-dlp file to youtube-dl, please rename it back.
- ytProvider in data/searches.yml now also controls where you're getting your song streams from.
  - (Invidious support added for .q)
