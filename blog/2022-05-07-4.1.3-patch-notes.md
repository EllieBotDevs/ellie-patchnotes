- Added support for embed arrays in commands such as 'say, 'greet, 'bye, etc...
  - Website to create them is live at https://eb.elliebot.net (old one is moved to https://oldeb.elliebot.net)
  - Embed arrays don't have a plainText property (it's renamed to 'content')
  - Embed arrays use color hex values instead of an integer
